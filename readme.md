# Intro: #

My dotfiles were mostly borrowed from:

    https://github.com/shawncplus/dotfiles
    https://github.com/nelstrom/dotfiles
    https://github.com/haridas/Dotfiles
    https://github.com/mbrochh/vim-as-a-python-ide

# Installation: #

    git clone git://github.com/whelmingbytes/dotfiles.git

Where possible, Vim plugins are installed as git submodules. Check these out by
running the commands:

    cd dotfiles
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

# Install: #

Be sure to backup anything like ~/.bashrc or ~/.vimrc as this will delete them.

    $ ~/dotfiles/install
