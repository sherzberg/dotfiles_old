Installation

    git clone git://github.com/whelmingbytes/dotfiles.git

Where possible, Vim plugins are installed as git submodules. Check these out by
running the commands:

    cd dotfiles
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

Install (be sure to backup anything like ~/.bashrc or ~/.vimrc as this will delete them):

    $ ~/dotfiles/install
